        Masha and the Bear (Russian: Ма́ша и Медве́дь, romanized: Máša i Medvéd' Russian pronunciation: [ˈmaʂə i mʲɪdˈvʲetʲ])
        is a Russian preschool comedy computer-animated television series created by Oleg Kuzovkov and produced by Animaccord 
        Animation Studio, loosely based on the oral children's folk story of the same name. The show focuses on the adventures
         of a very young girl named Masha and her caring friend, the bear (miška) that always keeps her safe from disasters.

        Masha and The Bear is the most watched preschool series in the world, with 36 times more requests than the average. It is also
        the fifth most-watched youth series (0–18) worldwide, just ahead of Peppa Pig.[1]

        Many of the episodes have been successful on YouTube. In particular, the Russian-language
        version of the episode "Маша плюс каша" ("Maša plûs kaša" or "Recipe for Disaster") 
        has almost 4.5 billion views as of April 2022, making it the site's twelfth most viewed 
        video of all time, and the most viewed video on YouTube that is not a music video.[2]

        The show was first launched in June 2016. It was the first Russian-produced animated TV
        show to be released in 4K.[citation n</p></div>
